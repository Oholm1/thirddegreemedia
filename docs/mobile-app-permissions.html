    <h1>How App Permissions Leak You  Mobile Privacy Guide</h1>
    <p>This is a short, practical guide explaining common mobile permissions (location, microphone, camera, storage, contacts) and the privacy risks they pose. Grant permissions only when needed, prefer one-time or while using access, and audit apps regularly.</p>

    <h2>Quick checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Review apps with Location, Microphone, Camera and Storage access.</li>
      <li>Revoke background location for apps that don't need it.</li>
      <li>Uninstall apps you don't use.</li>
      <li>Use one-time permissions when available.</li>
    </ul>
