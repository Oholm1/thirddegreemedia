    <h2 id="intro">Context</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a Minnesota resident following <strong>HF&nbsp;2699</strong>, a 2025 bill that would change how our state treats psilocybin.
      I’m sharing my stance to support informed public discussion—not to encourage illegal activity.
      Please read the bill text and make up your own mind.

      <li>Establish protections and a <em>Psychedelic Medicine Board</em>.</li>

    <h2 id="why-i-support">Why I Support It</h2>
    <p><strong>Personal sovereignty &amp; responsibility.</strong> Adults should be trusted to make informed choices without fear of criminalization.</p>
    <p><strong>Harm reduction over punishment.</strong> Education and honest information keep people safer than prohibition.</p>
    <p><strong>Mental health potential.</strong> Emerging research points to benefits for depression, PTSD, and end-of-life distress when used responsibly in appropriate settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Thoughtful regulation.</strong> A structured framework and public-health approach is better than the status quo.</p>
