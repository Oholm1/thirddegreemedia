    <h1>ü¶† Rituals of Purge</h1>
    <p><strong>Preface:</strong> This codex documents personal encounters with malicious software and the sovereign rituals I performed to remove them‚Äîwithout relying on corporate antivirus tools.</p>
    <p><strong>I do not condone, endorse, promote, or participate in the creation, distribution, or use of malware.</strong> I am not affiliated with any individuals or entities involved in malicious software development or propagation.</p>
    <p>This documentation is shared for educational and archival purposes only. It reflects my own experiences and signal hygiene practices. It is not a guide, tutorial, or encouragement to seek out malware or engage in unsafe behavior.</p>
    <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:</strong> I am not responsible for any consequences, damages, or disruptions that may occur should you go looking for, downloading, or interacting with any software, programs, or files referenced in this log. Proceed at your own risk‚Äîand preferably, don‚Äôt proceed at all.</p>

  <h2>Codex Entry #002: The Core-Starved Specter</h2>
  <p>Obviously, your first line of defense should be a proper antivirus. But if you're like me and prefer sovereignty over dependency, here's what I suggest.</p>
  <p>Use a tool like <strong>Process Lasso</strong>. The goal is to starve the virus of your PC‚Äôs resources. Process Lasso lets you tweak process behavior‚Äîmost notably, assigning specific processes to designated CPU cores.</p>
  <p>If you‚Äôre running an Intel CPU, you‚Äôve got <strong>P-cores</strong> (performance) and <strong>E-cores</strong> (efficiency). Assign the virus‚Äôs PID to an <strong>E-core</strong>, preferably the last one available. You‚Äôve now locked it to a single core typically reserved for background tasks. It‚Äôs not a full purge, but it‚Äôs containment. A digital quarantine. From there, you can monitor, isolate, and eventually remove the threat manually.</p>
