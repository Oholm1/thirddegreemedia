    <h2>Codex Entry #001: The Phantom Pop-Up</h2>
    <p><em>Symptoms:</em> Browser kept opening random tabs to sketchy sites. Task Manager showed a rogue process named ‚Äúsysupdater.exe‚Äù.</p>
    <p><em>Ritual:</em> Booted into Safe Mode. Located the process via Process Explorer. Deleted associated registry keys and temp files. Scrubbed startup entries manually.</p>
    <p><em>Outcome:</em> System stabilized. No AV used. Signal restored.</p>
