    <h2>Codex Entry #001: The Phantom Pop-Up</h2>
    <p><em>Symptoms:</em> Obviously your first line of defense should be a proper antivirus, but if you're like me and want to be sovereign, here's what I suggest: </p>
    <p><em>Ritual:</em> Use a tool like Process Lasso, basically what you want to do is starve the virus of your PC's resources, Process Lasso let's you tweak a lot of things, most noteabley assigning processes to certain cores in your PC.</p>
    <p><em>Outcome:</em> Say you have an Intel CPU, Intel uses P cores (performance) and E cores (efficiancy). Assign the virus's PID to an E core, preferably the last one available. You've just now locked it to one single core that are used for background processes, it's a good start.</p>
